# OpenSpaceMining
a starting point for open source hard- and software for space mining, e.g. asteroid mining

mining in space is still kinda a utopian drem, but if humanity works together and shares it's knowledge it can reach everything.
space mining could solve basically all our ressource-problems, we wouldn't need to destroy our Earth anymore.
We only have this one Earth, we all need it, we all owe our existence to the Earth, but we destroy it further every day in our not ending need to grow.
